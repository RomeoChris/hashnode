## 180 days of code - Scratch to React Framework

**July 1st, 2022** - I decided to learn web development from scratch last month and that journey begins today. This resolution means I would unlearn everything known and learn from the basics of web development, then pick React JS framework to focus on. 

This learning process will be in phases using the roadmap.sh as a guide and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) as my online tutors. 

It is hard to state or say which method or way of learning is the best because humans are configured differently. The availability of many resources and tutorials also contributes to this uncertainty of a 100% learning path. 

For **Day 1 of 180,** I started by getting familiar with the internet, my laptop and setting up my integrated development environment IDE (coding environment). Before you can understand how to program the web, you need a better understanding of the web. 

**What is the internet and how does the internet work?**
**The internet** is a large network of computers all connected. **All websites** are just a bunch of files stored on a computer called **Servers.** The server is connected to the internet, and then loads the website through a client - browser (Chrome or Firefox) on your phone or computer. The basis of the internet is the same for every connection made. The client (browsers) gets and loads data from the server, as well as submits data back to the server. 

Another keyword frequently used while talking about the internet is **IP Address:** This is a unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

A list of other terms includes;
- **ISP:** This means Internet Service Provider - ISP is how you gain access to the internet. [Read more about ISP here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
- **DNS:** This means Domain Name System - DNS is a computer server that contains a database of public IP addresses and their associated hostnames and in most cases, resolves or translates those names to IP addresses.

**Installations:**
Setting up a development environment is an essential and good step in building any website. You could use in-browser code editors AKA sandboxes which give you the tools needed to accomplish tasks. The in-browser code editors are great and best for getting started quickly. 

Honestly, setting up a real development environment is tasking but it is definitely worth it. Installing editors, packages or an entire operating system could pass for an awesome experience - an invaluable skill to add to your bag. 

For these 6months of relearning, I already have some of these tools installed. These are; 
- Windows operating system
- A Firefox developer edition browser
- Visual Studio Code (IDE) with necessary extensions installed. [View list of the extensions here](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/a-guide-to-the-20-best-vscode-extensions-for-frontend-developers-f75a5d716091)
- Git and Github profile 

I know and already made use of these tools hence it was easier for me to simply do a doctor's round on them. This might not be the same for you hence I compiled the following resources as shared on The Odin Project for you. 

- [Click to learn how to use Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) 
- [Learn basics of using Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line#readme)
- Tutorial on setting up git will be my next post

My day 1 of 180 ended with me writing this article. My next post will be on setting up git, using of command line and pushing my first 180 Days code. 

I hope you loved this read? It's my first shot at educating via articles - a step away from the verbal method. Leave your reactions and comments - Thank you.
